 THE ELJ PROJECT ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF ELJ 0.7, OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
 AND LIBRARY BINDINGS FOR EIFFEL

 Germany/Australia -- June 25, 2003. The ELJ Project is pleased to
 announce the release of version 0.7.


 The ELJ Project - http://elj.sourceforge.net/ - has the aim of providing
 a platform for the development and support of open source libraries for
 Eiffel developers. From this platform, significant applications can now
 be developed.

 The 0.7 release marks a significant milestone for the project as we now
 provide support of the libraries under both SmartEiffel and ISE Eiffel.
 Prior to this release, support was only provided for SmartEiffel. The
 GOBO-Eiffel libraries and tools, as well as new ELJ Eifffel/C interface
 classes, facilitated the support of both compilers. Those inclined to
 provide multi-compiler support for their own libraries and applications
 are encouraged to learn and build upon this approach.


 Changes:

  * Adapted to SmartEiffel (version 1.1)
  * ISE Eiffel compatible (version 5.3)
  * development of configuration scripts to target library dependencies
    to selected Eiffel compiler and backend C compiler.
  * interfaced wxWindows version is 2.4.1
  * Lua 5.0 support
  * libxml2 support
  * a bunch of new wxEiffel classes, see documentation for wxEiffel
  * examples added and improved
  * new base classes (multi dimensional array, random number class etc)
  * except for the wxEiffel.dll, eljgc.dll and sleepycat.dll, we do not
    ship dlls any more, so please install the dynamic libs (libxml2, Lua,
    sqlite etc) as you need them. The 0.8 release will provide built
    scripts for the generation of interface dll's and libs. Ask at
    elj-devel for more details, if required.


 The ELJ Project supports several applications, relational databases,
 native libraries and bindings to popular APIs.

 GUI:
    * wxEiffel: http://elj.sourceforge.net/projects/gui/ewxw/
           wxWindows: http://www.wxwindows.org

      wxEiffel is a GUI toolkit for the Eiffel programming language.
      It allows Eiffel programmers to create programs with a robust,
      highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily.
      It is implemented as a Eiffel interface library that wraps the
      popular wxWindows cross platform GUI library, which is written
      in C++.

      A by-product from the wxEiffel project has been the development
      of wx-c, a C interface to the wxWindows C++ library. The
      wxHaskell project now co-maintains wx-c, as it is now integral
      to their project. We hope that other projects can take advantage
      of wx-c.

 Database Interfaces:
    * Firebird  http://elj.sf.net/projects/db/firebird/
    * Berkely DB (SleepyCat)  http://elj.sf.net/projects/db/sleepycat/
    * MySQL  http://elj.sf.net/projects/db/mysql/
    * PostgreSQL  http://elj.sf.net/projects/db/postgres/
    * SQLite  http://elj.sf.net/projects/db/sqlite/

 Lua Interface:
    * Lua: an embeddable scripting language
      http://elj.sf.net/projects/other/lua/

 libxml Interface:
    * http://www.libxml.org/

 Compression:
    * zlib  http://elj.sf.net/projects/other/compression/zlib/
    * bzip2  http://elj.sf.net/projects/other/compression/bzip2/

 OS Support
    * elj-win32api  http://elj.sf.net/projects/os/win32api/

 Native Libraries:
    * Common libraries -- a libraries that provide time, random number,
      support libraries to support development of Eiffel/C interfaces.

 Applications:
    * ELJ GIRLS -- a CRM, especially for software companies, based on
       wxEiffel and Firebird. http://www.sf.net/projects/elj-girls
    * Diuturnal -- a multiplayer turn-based strategy game, containing
      a mix of Civilization and Warcraft. Based on the wxEiffel.
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/diuturnal/
    * SEED2 -- a SmartEiffel IDE (underdevelopment)
