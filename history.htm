        <p><font face="Arial">Those who would research Baptist history via the Internet be warned:&nbsp;
        there is an abundance of information about Baptist history, but most of it comes from
        biased perspectives which are fed from personal agendas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">There is a long-held saying among Baptists:&nbsp; when you
        get two Baptists together, you get three difference opinions!&nbsp; This is most evident
        when one reads online Baptist history resources:&nbsp; many seem bent on proving
        that their particular view of Baptist history is the one and only true understanding of
        Baptist history.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">History, in fact, is subject to various 
        (and often contradictory) interpretations.&nbsp; 
        Baptist history is not exempt from the interpretive confusion.&nbsp; 
        Indeed, Baptists are even in disagreement over how they originated!</font></p>
        <p><strong><a name="Views of Baptist Origins"><u><font face="Arial">Views of
        Baptist Origins</font></u></a></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1.&nbsp; <u>Outgrowth of English Separatism</u> -- In this
        view, the Baptist faith originated from within the Separatist movement, a movement which
        arose in Europe with the goal of breaking away from the Church of England (which
        previously had broken away from the Catholic Church, yet retained many of the trappings;
        those within the Church of England who wished to remain a part of the Church and yet
        purify it became known as "Puritans;" they were, in a sense, cousins to
        Separatists). &nbsp; The influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists is considered
        minimal, according to this viewpoint.&nbsp; The earliest Baptist church is traced back to
        1609 in Amsterdam, with John Smyth as pastor.&nbsp; The group's embracing of
        "believer's baptism" became the defining moment which led to the establishment
        of this first Baptist church. &nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group, and Thomas
        Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611.&nbsp; This
        view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted
        view of Baptist origins. &nbsp; Representative writers include William H. Whitsitt, Robert
        G. Torbet, Winthrop S. Hudson, William G. McLoughlin and Robert A. Baker.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">2.&nbsp; <u>Influence of Anabaptists</u> -- This view holds
        that although Baptists originated from English Separatism, their emergence owes much to
        the earlier Anabaptists.&nbsp; According to this view, some early Baptists were influenced
        by some Anabaptists.&nbsp; The Dutch Mennonites (Anabaptists), for example, shared some
        similarities with General Baptists (believer's baptism, religious liberty, separation of
        church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin).
        &nbsp; However, other than this, there were significant differences between Anabaptists
        and Baptists (Anabaptists tended towards extreme pacifism, communal sharing of earthly
        goods, and an unorthodox optimistic view of human nature).&nbsp; Therefore, few Baptists
        hold to this theory of Baptist origins.&nbsp; Representative writers include A.C.
        Underwood and William R. Estep.&nbsp; Among some contemporary Baptist 
        scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the 
        Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">3.&nbsp; <u>Continuation of Biblical Teachings</u> -- Some
        Baptists "seek to go back beyond the Anabaptist movement to trace the continuity of
        Baptist forms of faith through the centuries" (Leon McBeth, The Baptist Heritage,
        page 56).&nbsp; While advocates of this view do not claim a succession of organized
        Baptist churches (see below), they believe that Baptist faith and practice have existed
        since the time of Christ.&nbsp; This view has a goodly number of advocates, including a
        number of early Baptist historians, many of whom were concerned with presenting the
        validity of their faith (denomination) over and above that of other denominations. &nbsp;
        Some representative writers of an earlier era include Thomas Crosby (one of the earliest Baptist historians,
        he wrote in the early 1700s), A.H. Newman and David Benedict. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp; <u>Succession of Baptist Churches</u> -- This
        viewpoint goes beyond mere "continuation of biblical teachings" and  declares
        that Baptist churches actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ and
        John the Baptist.&nbsp; Commonly referred to as "Landmarkism" or the "Trail
        of Blood" theory (J.M.Carroll wrote a book of supposed Baptist history by this name),
        this view declares that those churches which stood outside the influence of the Roman
        Catholic Church at various times in church history were, in actuality although not in
        name, Baptist churches.&nbsp; That which made them Baptists was their refusal to accept
        infant baptism, or, said another way, their refusal to accept the legitimacy of the Roman
        Catholic Church as a Christian entity.&nbsp; However, many of the historical churches
        which Landmarkists label as Baptist churches were actually heretical in regards to
        doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, the "Landmarkist" view, which has little
        actual historical support, remains popular among certain Baptists.&nbsp; The reason for
        its moderate popularity (and, indeed, strong popularity among some rural Baptists in the
        southern and western United States) stems (to some degree) from a long-standing dislike
        (if not hate) of Catholics by many Baptists.&nbsp; Representative writers of this viewpoint include J.M Carroll, G.H.
        Orchard and J.M. Cramp.&nbsp; It should also be noted that, 
        interestingly enough, much of
        the Baptist history material thus far posted on the Internet is Landmarkist in nature,
        indicating that Landmarkers are yet a very vocal lot.</font></p>

        <p><strong><a name="The Reformed Debate"><font face="Arial">The Reformed Debate</font></a></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">In
addition to the long-running debate over Baptist origins, a new debate
is now prominent in Baptist life:&nbsp; the question over whether or
not Baptists (and particularly Southern Baptists) are historically
Calvinistic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Founders Journal (see below), along with
Dr. Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary, is doing an admirable job in championing the belief that
Southern Baptists have always been strict (5 point) Calvinists.&nbsp;
Their efforts do fall short of the truth, however, for although
Baptists (including Southern Baptists) have certainly been influenced
by Calvinism, they have also been much influenced by Arminianism, which
historically served to moderate Calvinism and produce a warmly
evangelistic theology as mirrored in the Great Awakenings.&nbsp; Most
Baptists today hold beliefs from both Calvinistic and Arminian schools
of thought.&nbsp; The current Calvinistic debate about Baptist history
has reached the point where it is now affecting many Baptist churches
throughout America.&nbsp; The reader will note that a number of the
online Baptist history resources listed below are from the Reformed (or
Calvinist) perspective.&nbsp; The reader should also note that within
the past few years, some Reformed (or Calvinist) Baptists have shifted
to using the milder-sounding terminology of "doctrines of grace" rather
than "Calvinism."</font></p>

        <p><strong><a name="The Southern Baptist Controversy"><font face="Arial">
        The Southern Baptist Controversy and Beyond</font></a></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Finally, the 1980s to the present have witnessed a new
        fundamentalist controversy (also often referred to as a "political" and 
        / or
        "biblical" controversy) within the largest Baptist denomination, which has
        altered the course of Southern Baptist history, and Baptist history in 
        general.&nbsp; The minority fundamentalists, now
        firmly in charge of the national Southern Baptist Convention, have changed the direction
        and nature of the Convention, resulting in the first statistical decline of the
        denomination in some 75 years.&nbsp; They have sought to re-fashion Baptist history to
        validate their theology and their insurgency, and as a result have caused much confusion
        about Baptist history among Baptist laity and the general populace.&nbsp;  </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Whereas Baptists have historically been 
        non-creedal, the fundamentalist leadership of the SBC is forcing creedalism upon Southern Baptists 
        through the forced implementation of the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.&nbsp; Whereas Southern Baptists have 
        traditionally believed in the Priesthood of all Believers, the 
        fundamentalist leadership positions pastoral authority above the 
        Priesthood of Believers.&nbsp; Whereas Baptists have historically held 
        to the authority of Scripture and looked to Jesus and the Holy Spirit as 
        the criterion for interpreting the Bible, the fundamentalist leadership 
        claims that looking to Jesus and the Holy Spirit as the authority for 
        faith is a liberal position.&nbsp; Instead, they have positioned the 
        Baptist Faith and Message 2000, and/or a modern interpretation of 
        Biblical authority known as "inerrancy," as the only valid way in which to 
        approach Scripture.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As such, the fundamentalist leadership of 
        the SBC is bent upon refashioning Southern Baptist doctrine and polity 
        into the historical Roman Catholic model of creedalism and religious 
        hierarchy.&nbsp; This agenda continues to cause much division among 
        Baptists, including splits on the state level of Baptist life.&nbsp; 
        Currently, Texas, Virginia and Missouri each have two competing Baptist 
        conventions, with one convention in each state pledging loyalty to the 
        Baptist Faith and Message 2000, and the other convention in each state 
        contending that the Bible supercedes any human creeds.&nbsp; A number of 
        other states conventions, as well as Baptist associations, are witnessing a prolonged struggle over the issue of the 
        BF&amp;M 2000, with many denominational entities refusing the dictates 
        of the SBC to accept the BF&amp;M 2000 as their sole statement of belief.&nbsp; 
        In general, many state Baptist conventions are asserting their 
        autonomous rights in distancing themselves from the creedalistic, 
        fundamentalist SBC.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The year 2004 witnessed a significant new 
        development within the Southern Baptist Convention.&nbsp; The SBC 
        leadership defunded the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bwanet.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">
        Baptist World Alliance</a>, charging, falsely, that the BWA is a 
        liberal, un-American institution.&nbsp; In response, many state Baptist 
        conventions and local Southern Baptist churches have increased their 
        support of the BWA.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This year, 2006, a rupture within the Southern 
        Baptist Convention occurred, as some younger trustees of SBC agencies 
        are accusing the older leadership of being too narrow-minded; the older 
        leadership, in turn, views the younger leadership as being too liberal 
        (in reality, both parties are fundamentalists; this latest skirmish 
        demonstrates the extreme nature of fundamentalists' quest for purity).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">During the course of the Southern Baptist 
        controversy, a number of new entities have come into existence to 
        champion the very historic principles and cooperative spirit that the 
        SBC leaders have long since abandoned.&nbsp; These include the 
        denomination-like

        its exit from traditional Baptist life and deeper into

        entities will play a significant role in maintaining a Baptist witness
