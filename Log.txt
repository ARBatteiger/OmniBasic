Notes on new Log program:

The program will behave as before when called from WARP,
but will also allow command line parameter operation as
it may be used from a command window (DOS window) or in a
shell statement from Visual Basic or other scripting language.

The form of the command line operation is as follows:

Log StartDate EndDate File Path

Example:

Log 000221 000225 Test.csv C:\temp

Notice that the 4 feilds must be entered after the Log
command and must be separated by spaces.
