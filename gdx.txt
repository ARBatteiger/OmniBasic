I revised robot paths on the 001 glass for primer, adhesive and stacking.
The paths did not utilize the Remote tool center point and linear moves. In
that condition primer and adhesive application speeds were unknown and not
precise. Converted both programs to use proper tool center point and linear
motions.
I touched up robot paths on the 130 alternate glass patern.
This work was done on-sight during the week of August 16th.
17 hours at $81.50 = $1385.50
