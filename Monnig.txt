Monday traveled to site. Evaluated equipment and determined that the DL-470
Computer had failed.
Removed computer and returned to office to work on computer. Ordered an
adapter to allow us to extract the software off of the DL-470 hard drive.

Tuesday received the adapter and successfully removed and backed up all
programs on the DL-470 hard drive. Contacted Automation Direct to attempt to
get a downloadable install for the system. They recommended I contact the
original supplier National Instruments, Inc. They no longer supported the
software. They might be able to help me if I could find the original serial
number or order number. Contacted another person at Automation Direct. He
tracked down a copy of the old software that I could download. We down
loaded the software and then installed everything onto a new computer. The
default software install was not loading all necessary components. We had
to do a custom install and install the ODBC section before the software
became operational.
Service Time 5 hours.
