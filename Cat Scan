Subject:
Diana Smith's missing CAT Scan image(s)

If the subject image(s) cannot be found at Dr. Liberman's office
it may be helpful for you to know that the scan occurred on
Monday August 2, 2004 between the hours of 8:00 and 11:00 PM
when she was still in the Emergency Romm complex and just prior
to her admission to room 361 in the Oncology Ward.

The attending physician was the Doctor in a wheel chair. He showed me
the scans of the thorax and tibia on two different ViewSonic monitors
in the Emergency Room viewing area.

Hope this helps,

Mike Smith
