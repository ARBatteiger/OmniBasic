RE: diuretic for Diana Smith

Dr. Liberman has asked me to contact you concerning
a diuretic for Diana because of the retention of water
in here affected leg.

She has taken Spironolactone in the past and tolerates
it well. Also, we have a supply of both 25MG and 100MG
on hand.

Please advise us on the use of this medication as to suitability
and interaction. Also, please advise proper dosage.

In the event that this drug is not acceptable, please
provide a script for the proper type.

Regards,
