I reviewed the doumentation while waiting for a color change. After the
start of color change we verified the problem of the weigh values and power
values flucuating when the door was opened. After tracing the problem it was
determined that a wire had become disconnected from the power monitor. This
wire was in the analog circuit and caused electrical noise in the analog
input module of the Omron PLC. This caused the erratic operations of the
control.
