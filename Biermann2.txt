Don,

The 3 attached pages show the breakdown of the Misc Expenses.

The items marked Ford Truck are vehicle maintenance.

The items on the Aircraft are marked travel because the aircraft is leased (not owned)

The MBNA accounts are all interest since the cards were not being used for new purchases
and any payments made were to satisfy interest on the accounts.

If you have any questions, please call Mike Monahan or me.

Mike Smith
