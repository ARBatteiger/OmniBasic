While most acknowledge the leadership of OmniBasic in the area of portability,
it has been a well kept secret that OmniBasic is among the fastest Basics

and GFA Basic (considered by most as the ones to beat) have shown that OmniBasic
is the one to beat. These benchmark results are available upon request.
